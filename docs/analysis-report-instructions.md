## Creating the PDF

### Option 1: Microsoft Word / Google Docs
1. Open REPORT_TEMPLATE.md
2. Copy content to Word/Docs
3. Format nicely with headings, tables, plots
4. Export as PDF named `analysis-report.pdf`

### Option 2: LaTeX (recommended for professional look)
1. Use provided template structure
2. Add your plots to `performance-plots/`
3. Compile to PDF

### Option 3: Markdown to PDF
1. Use Pandoc: `pandoc REPORT_TEMPLATE.md -o analysis-report.pdf`
2. Or use online converter like markdown-pdf.com
